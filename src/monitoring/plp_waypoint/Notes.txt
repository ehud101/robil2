# Waypoint PLP
This package contains the waypoint PLP - the PLP responsible for predicting the result of navigating the Bobcat through a planned path.

## Running the node
Command to run the node:

    rosnode plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py

The node will listen to the proper topics, and issue a prediction on the first time a planned path is published, once a navigation task has become active. The prediction is sent to topic `plp/messages`.
